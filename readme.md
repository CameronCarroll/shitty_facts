What is Shitty Facts dot RB?
----------------------------
A simple script intended to be controlled by crontab (or manually I guess if you're super bored) which uses the TextBelt 
API to send SMS messages to a targeted phone number. (US only!) Keeps track of how many messages have been sent and when
the last one was in order to send a series of messages at a given time interval, Cat Facts style.
